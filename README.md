## Some of my projects

### Low-rank Optimal Transport and Application to Color Transfer 
[PDF](https://benoit-muller.github.io/Low_Rank_Approximation_Techniques_Project/publication.pdf) – [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Benoit-Muller/Low_Rank_Approximation_Techniques_Project)
<br />
**Abstract:** In this project, we aim to solve an entropy regularized version of the Kantorovich optimal transport problem, by using a low-rank approximation technique on Sinkhorn algorithm. We apply the method to color transfer for images. We obtain newly colored images, and by using the low-rank approximation technique with a rank of only 4% of the dimension, we obtain visually similar images with a time computation reduced by half.

### Fairness of Decision Algorithm in Machine Learning
[PDF](https://benoit-muller.github.io/Stat_ML_Project/report.pdf)
<br />
**Abstract:** 
In this report, we present a definition of fairness associated to a predictor function in a decision problem of machine learning. We then propose a post-processing step that can be used for a binary classification, that satisfy the notion of fairness. Lastly, we apply this method on a real data set about credit card default prediction and show the benefits of this method.
