## Low rank optimal transport and application to color transfer.
A project for the course Low-rank Approximation Techniques.

**Abstract:** In this project, we aim to solve an entropy regularized version of the Kantorovich optimal transport problem, by using a low-rank approximation technique on Sinkhorn algorithm. We apply the method to color transfer for images. We obtain newly colored images, and by using the low-rank approximation technique with a rank of only 4% of the dimension, we obtain visually similar images with a time computation reduced by half.
